Writing programs with object oriented programming helps keep programs maintainable and adaptable.  In the files, the py was created and can be used for other dbs or collections with just a few changes and the CRUD functions can adapt to a db by changing the collection name. Using simple variable names that describe what they do along with inline comments help anyone looks to use them know what the code is doing.  
I approach problems with research as there are so many resources out on the web.  I also think of different ways I can logically get through a function and try/test them out.  This was my first time working with a mongo database, with dashboard, and creating widgets so the documentation and research were invaluable.  Dashboard really made working with a database easy and creating visuals to go with it, I would go to that first if I were to need to make an app to work with a database in the future.   Computer scientists use their study of computers and how computers use and store data to solve problems in real life.  What computer scientists do matters because their work helps create fast and accurate programs that are used in all kinds of fields of science, medicine, economics, etc.  Getting up-to-date real-time information and being able to filter that information in a user-friendly environment can help all kinds of companies be more productive.
